# Arduino Hydroponics Garden Using IoT


This project is an IoT-enabled hydroponics garden powered by Arduino.  It automates essential gardening tasks such as water circulation, nutrient delivery, and environmental monitoring. Sensors track parameters like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water level, ensuring optimal plant growth. Real-time data is sent to a cloud platform for remote monitoring and control via a web or mobile app. The system supports customizable thresholds for automated actions like water pumps and fans. This project is perfect for DIY enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in smart gardening and IoT technology. Contributions and improvements are welcome to enhance functionality and scalability.
